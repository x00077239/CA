<h2>This is a bash script tutorial for a year 4 IT Student</h2>

<p>A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are a mixture of commands we would normally type ouselves on the command line (such as ls or cp)and commands we could type on the command line but generally wouldn't.</p>

<h3>Creating your own bash commands</h3>
</center>
Custom commands in Bash are known as “aliases”. Aliases are an abbreviation, or a means to avoid typing a long command sequence. They can save a great deal of typing at the command line so you can avoid having to remember complex combinations of commands and options.

<h3>Example of using aliases</h3>

Syntax: alias alias_name = “command_to_run”
A very simple example would look like this:

alias c = “clear”
Now every time you want to clear the screen, instead of typing in clear, you can just type c and you’ll be good to go. (information extracted from https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet</p>  

<h3>Using Bash Commands to display system analysis</h3>
<p>lspci - this will list the PCI devices within the system</p>
<p>lsusb - this will list the USB devices within the system</p>
<p>lsmod - this will list the drivers within the system</p>

<h3>To continously display System Log</h3>
<p>To continually display the system log you should use this command: tail ­f /var/log/syslog</p>

<h3>File Properties</h3>
<p>Using the statmyfile command will list the name, size, type, permissions, owner, time stamps
info on file system containing statmyfile</p>

<h3>Disk tools</h3>
<p>using df will display disk space and usage for all drives</p>
<p>using mount will display all mounted devices</p>
<p>using sync will write all pending operations to disk
Very important to do before retreiving a USB stick or a
memory card!</p>

<h3>Time Processes</h3>
<p>to execute a program every 10 seconds you would use the following command watch ­n 10  myprogram</p>
